	<li><span class="version version-unique">unique</span> - package is only present in a single repository family, there are no other sources to compare it against, so although it's the latest version known to repology, is not really reliable.</li>

	<li><span class="version version-legacy">legacy</span> - outdated version when a newer version is present. This is assumed to be legacy version preserved for e.g. compatibility.</li>

	<li><span class="version version-newest">vulnerable<span class="vulnerable">â–²</span></span> - version is potentially vulnerable as there are related CVEs.</li>
